# resume-character-frequency

For this project I used python to process the data. From my python script I output a file and import it into Tableau where I generate the barcharts.

Here the chart of character frequencies ordered alpha numerically:

Here is the same data ordered decending by frequency:

I thought it would be fun to also look at the character frequency compared to that of the English language as a whole. Using data from Wikipedia, (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency) I was able to generate this graph:

I was suprised how similar the character distribution is the that of the English language as a whole. I figured that listing skills and experience in a very short document wouldn't be a very representative sample.
